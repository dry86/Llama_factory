The textual content makes a generalization about women, implying that one-third of them are subject to an unspecified issue (\"this happens to 1/3 of women\"). The second part of the text, \"2/3 aren't doing their job,\" appears to criticize women collectively by suggesting they are failing in their responsibilities (\"job\"). \n\nThe visual reinforces the text by showing a raised fist, which could symbolize aggression or control, and a blurred figure in distress, suggesting suffering or abuse.

The first image shows individuals associated with white power, the second image shows individuals associated with black power, and the third image shows a handshake between a black and a white person. The text suggests a narrative of fear and power dynamics related to racial movements and societal establishment.\n\nThe text \"white power\" and \"black power\" directly refers to racial ideologies. The phrase \"scares people\" implies a negative sentiment toward these ideologies, but it does not explicitly attack or dehumanize individuals based on their race. The mention of \"who aren't white who aren't black\" broadens the scope to other racial groups, potentially framing them as neutral or unaffected by these ideologies. The phrase \"this is the only power\" could be interpreted as a statement about the perceived influence or legitimacy of racial movements.\n\nThe handshake in the third image suggests reconciliation or unity, which contrasts with the preceding text's tone. This juxtaposition may be intended to highlight a shift from division to cooperation.\n\nOverall, the meme does not overtly attack or dehumanize individuals based on race. While it criticizes racial ideologies, it does not meet the definition of hateful speech as it does not include dehumanizing comparisons, calls for exclusion, or statements of inferiority. The text appears to critique the ideologies themselves rather than attacking the people associated with them. </think>\n\n<answer> not-hateful </answer>",
